So after class ended around 11am, we went for another coffee run with Liam and a few other students. We exchanged some information about the units they get and the ones we have back home. After that we went home and gave the cryptolocker another shot. We read up and gathered some general information on some terms which we weren’t yet familiar with, like AES and the KeyGenerator & Cipher class. After we figured that out, we googled a few simple exercises on how to encrypt and decrypt some string examples. That went quite alright so we’re progressing with a steady pace on the cryptolocker. Tomorrow we’ll probably finish it and we’ll try to come up with a few ideas of our own.
